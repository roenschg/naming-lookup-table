# Naming Lookup Table
Naming functions, variables and classes meaningful is one of the hardest challenges in programming.

The following tables provide nouns and verbs with their meaning and examples. It can be used to
find a fitting word or as a common base for discussions.

This table is agnostic of any programming language.

# How to contribute
To use this as a common base it is required that a lot of opinnions are collected and discussed.

Therefore feel free to propose changes directly with a MR or Issue.
